# Selfie - Agentic Build System

## Project Overview

**Selfie** is an agentic build system that builds itself. This is a revolutionary approach to software development where the system evolves and improves through autonomous agents that respond to human input and create their own development tasks.

## Current Phase: MCP Server Development

We are currently in **Phase 1: MCP Server Development**. During this phase, we are building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Selfie instances to interact with each other. This MCP server is the foundational automation layer that will enable the system to create changes to itself based on human input and coordinate between multiple Selfie instances.
